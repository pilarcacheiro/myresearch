## Pilar Cacheiro
### Research Fellow in Computational Biology
##### William Harvey Research Institute - Queen Mary University of London

Computational biologist focused on the integrative analysis of model organisms and human data to improve the understanding of the molecular basis of disease, with a particular interest in neurodevelopmental disorders. The ultimate goals of my research are to assist the genetic diagnosis of patients affected with rare diseases and to understand the molecular mechanisms behind gene essentiality.

Main interests: gene essentiality, phenotypes, statistics and R.
